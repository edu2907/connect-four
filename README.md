# Connect Four

A two-player connection board game

Made with Ruby for the [Connect Four Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-connect-four) from The Odin Project

This is my first project following TDD principles with Rspec. In overall, the coding process was fine, but I struggled a little bit with the testing part. Which I expected, because the purpose is to put in practice TDD.
